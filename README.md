Version 1.7

## Introduction

PHP Syllable splitting and hyphenation.
or rather...
PHP Syl-la-ble split-ting and hy-phen-ation.

Based on the work by Frank M. Liang (http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/)
and the many volunteers in the TeX community.

Many languages supported. i.e. english (us/uk), spanish, german, french, dutch,
italian, romanian, russian, etc. 76 languages in total.

Language sources: http://tug.org/tex-hyphen/#languages

Supports PHP 5.6 and up, so you can use it on older servers.


## Installation

Install phpSyllable via Composer

```
composer require vanderlee/syllable
```

or simply add phpSyllable to your project and set up the project's 
autoloader for phpSyllable's src/ directory.


## Usage

Instantiate a Syllable object and start hyphenation.

Minimal example:

```php
$syllable = new \Vanderlee\Syllable\Syllable('en-us');
echo $syllable->hyphenateText('Provide a plethora of paragraphs');
```

Extended example:

```php
use Vanderlee\Syllable\Syllable;
use Vanderlee\Syllable\Hyphen;

// Globally set the directory where Syllable can store cache files.
// By default, this is the cache/ folder in this package, but usually
// you want to have the folder outside the package. Note that the cache
// folder must be created beforehand.
Syllable::setCacheDir(__DIR__ . '/cache');

// Globally set the directory where the .tex files are stored.
// By default, this is the languages/ folder of this package and
// usually does not need to be adapted.
Syllable::setLanguageDir(__DIR__ . '/languages');

// Create a new instance for the language.
$syllable = new Syllable('en-us');

// Set the style of the hyphen. In this case it is the "-" character.
// By default, it is the soft hyphen "&shy;".
$syllable->setHyphen(new Hyphen\Dash());

// Set the minimum word length required for hyphenation.
// By default, all words are hyphenated.
$syllable->setMinWordLength(5);

// Output hyphenated text ..
echo $syllable->hyphenateText('Provide your own paragraphs...');
// .. or hyphenated HTML.
echo $syllable->hyphenateHtmlText('<b>... with highlighted text.</b>');
```

See the [demo.php](demo.php) file for a working example.


## `Syllable` API reference

The following describes the API of the main Syllable class. In most cases, 
you will not use any other functions. Browse the code under src/ for all 
available functions.

#### public __construct($language = 'en-us', string|Hyphen $hyphen = null)

Create a new Syllable class, with defaults.

#### public static setCacheDir(string $dir)

Set the directory where compiled language files may be stored.
Default to the `cache` subdirectory of the current directory.

#### public static setEncoding(string|null $encoding = null)

Set the character encoding to use.
Specify `null` encoding to not apply any encoding at all.

#### public static setLanguageDir(string $dir)

Set the directory where language source files can be found.
Default to the `languages` subdirectory of the current directory.

#### public setLanguage(string $language)

Set the language whose rules will be used for hyphenation.

#### public setHyphen(mixed $hyphen)

Set the hyphen text or object to use as a hyphen marker.

#### public getHyphen(): Hyphen

Get the current hyphen object.

#### public setCache(Cache $cache = null)

#### public getCache(): Cache

#### public setSource($source)

#### public getSource(): Source

#### public setMinWordLength(int $length = 0)

Words need to contain at least this many character to be hyphenated.

#### public getMinWordLength(): int

#### public setLibxmlOptions(int $libxmlOptions)

Options to use for HTML parsing by libxml.
**See:** https://www.php.net/manual/de/libxml.constants.php.

#### public excludeAll()

Exclude all elements.

#### public excludeElement(string|string[] $elements)

Add one or more elements to exclude from HTML.

#### public excludeAttribute(string|string[] $attributes, $value = null)

Add one or more elements with attributes to exclude from HTML.

#### public excludeXpath(string|string[] $queries)

Add one or more xpath queries to exclude from HTML.

#### public includeElement(string|string[] $elements)

Add one or more elements to include from HTML.

#### public includeAttribute(string|string[] $attributes, $value = null)

Add one or more elements with attributes to include from HTML.

#### public includeXpath(string|string[] $queries)

Add one or more xpath queries to include from HTML.

#### public splitWord(string $word): array

Split a single word on where the hyphenation would go.
Punctuation is not supported, only simple words. For parsing whole sentences
please use Syllable::splitWords() or Syllable::splitText().

#### public splitWords(string $text): array

Split a text into an array of punctuation marks and words,
splitting each word on where the hyphenation would go.

#### public splitText(string $text): array

Split a text on where the hyphenation would go.

#### public hyphenateWord(string $word): string

Hyphenate a single word.

#### public hyphenateText(string $text): string

Hyphenate all words in the plain text.

#### public hyphenateHtml(string $html): string

Hyphenate all readable text in the HTML, excluding HTML tags and
attributes.
**Deprecated:** Use the UTF-8 capable hyphenateHtmlText() instead. This method is kept only for backward compatibility and will be removed in the next major version 2.0.

#### public hyphenateHtmlText(string $html): string

Hyphenate all readable text in the HTML, excluding HTML tags and
attributes.
This method is UTF-8 capable and should be preferred over hyphenateHtml().

#### public histogramText(string $text): array

Count the number of syllables in the text and return a map with
syllable count as key and number of words for that syllable count as
the value.

#### public countWordsText(string $text): int

Count the number of words in the text.

#### public countSyllablesText(string $text): int

Count the number of syllables in the text.

#### public countPolysyllablesText(string $text): int

Count the number of polysyllables in the text.


## Development

### Update language files

Run
```
composer dump-autoload --dev
./build/update-language-files
```
to fetch the latest language files remotely and optionally use environment variables to customize the update process:

#### CONFIGURATION_FILE
Specify the absolute path of the configuration file where the language files to be downloaded are defined. The 
configuration file has the following format: 
```
{
	"files": [
		{
			"_comment": "<comment>",
			"fromUrl": "<absolute-remote-file-url>",
			"toPath": "<relative-local-file-path>",
			"disabled": <true|false>
		}
	]
}
```
where the attributes are self-explanatory and `_comment` and `disabled` are optional. See for example 
[build/update-language-files.json](build/update-language-files.json). 
Default: The `build/update-language-files.json` file of this package.

#### MAX_REDIRECTS

Specify the maximum number of URL redirects allowed when retrieving a language file.
Default: `1`.

#### WITH_COMMIT

Create (1) or skip (0) a Git commit from the updated language files.
Default: `0`.

#### LOG_LEVEL

Set the verbosity of the script to verbose (6), warnings and errors (4), errors only (3) or silent (0).
Default: `6`.

For example use
```
composer dump-autoload --dev
LOG_LEVEL=0 ./build/update-language-files
```
to silently run the script without outputting any logging.

### Update API documentation

Run
```
composer dump-autoload --dev
./build/generate-docs
```
to update the API documentation in this README.md. This should be done when the Syllable class has been modified.
Optionally, you can use environment variables to modify the documentation update process:

#### WITH_COMMIT

Create (1) or skip (0) a Git commit from the adapted files.
Default: `0`.

#### LOG_LEVEL

Set the verbosity of the script to verbose (6), warnings and errors (4), errors only (3) or silent (0).
Default: `6`.

### Create release

Run
```
composer dump-autoload --dev
./build/create-release
```
to create a local release of the project by adding a changelog to this README.md.
Optionally, you can use environment variables to modify the release process:

#### RELEASE_TYPE

Set the release type to major (0), minor (1) or patch (2) release.
Default: `2`.

#### WITH_COMMIT

Create (1) or skip (0) a Git commit from the adapted files and apply the release tag.
Default: `0`.

#### LOG_LEVEL

Set the verbosity of the script to verbose (6), warnings and errors (4), errors only (3) or silent (0).
Default: `6`.

### Tests

Run
```
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
to execute the tests.
